                You are walking downtown, it is dead silent. The year is 1984 and you have just finished work and are heading home for the day. The air is thick and dirty, and you feel as though you are always being watched. You had just visited your favorite bookstore and had secretly purchased a diary, which is illegal. Out of the corner of your eye you spot a hidden figure in an alleyway as you walk by. You pause and consider who it might be but don't know what to do. You must make a decision.
